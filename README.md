Our search engine was implemented with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture.

The Structure:
-------------

1.	Select the next 'parts percentage (%), of the documents from the corpus.
2.	Send these documents to the Parser.
3.	Optional: send the output of the Parser to the Stemmer.
4.	Send the output to the Indexer. The Indexer will create a temporary index file for the documents from step one.
5.	Go back to step one until the coverage will be 100 percentage.
6.	Create final posting file from all the temporary files that were created in step 4.
7.	Finish the preprocessing stage.

The Model:
-------------
 ReadFile – This module reads documents from the corpus.

- Parser – Parses the documents (removes stop-words, converts dates to a unified format etc.).

- Stemmer – Performs stemming on a given document. We used porter's for JAVA 8.

- Indexer – Creates the final posting file separated by alphabet letters.

- Searcher – 

- Ranker –

- GUI (view)
